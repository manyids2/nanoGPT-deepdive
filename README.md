# nanoGPT


Ideas:

0. Visualize -> how much data is generated in one forward pass?
1. Linear -> tree
2. Synthetic data, predict and confirm behaviour
3. Switch out neural networks for handcrafted mocks
4. text vs code
5. Train for various block sizes, compare with our method of position embedding
6. Cross channel training
7. Embed context of tree ( cartesian product )

## Install

```
